# tidybiplot tasks

## augmentation

functions to augment the output of an ordination function to the original dataset

## object classes

`as_bibble()` and `to_bibble()` methods for the following biplot classes:
- `lm`, `mlm`, and `glm`
- `isoMDS()`
- `svd`
- `prcomp`, `princomp`, and [other PCA classes](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/how-to/2012/06/17/PCA-in-R/)
- multidimensional scaling (MDS) with `cmdscale()`
- `lda`
- `ca` and [other CA classes](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/how-to/2012/07/19/Correspondence-Analysis/)
- functions (and classes?) from the **vegan** package: `cca()` and `rda()`; `metaMDS()`; `decorana()`
- `mca` and [other MCA classes](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/how-to/2012/10/13/MCA-in-R/)
- `NMF`
- [other matrix decomposition methods](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html)

the `bbl` class:
- `as_bibble()` wraps a biplot object with the `bbl` class so that methods can extract basic information (matrix factors, coordinates) necessary for printing and visualization
- `to_bibble()` flattens a biplot object into a list of basic matrix factorization information from which the original object is unrecoverable
- Decide whether `bbl` objects should be stored (a) as separate $U$ and $V$ tibbles or (b) as a single tibble with a `.matrix` variable (so that `tidy()` simply removes the `bbl` class and certain attributes).
- As long as `ggplot()` uses `fortify()` internally to handle objects, this package should use `fortify.bbl()` to convert ordination objects into data frames for plotting.
- Determine how to retain inertia information, and for which classes.

## formatting methods

`print.bbl`: Separate the matrices (by way of coordinates) from the annotation variables, maybe by a vertical line?

`plot.bbl`: `fortify() %>% plot()`?

## verbs

### bibble to vector

`pull_*()`: Extract an annotation from either $U$ or $V$.

### bibble to bibble

`select_*()`/`rename_*()`: Restrict to and/or rename annotation while keeping all coordinates.

`mutate_*()`/`transmute_*()`: Introduce a new annotation as a function of others, and optionally discard all others.

`project_*()`: Restrict to a subset of coordinates but keep annotation. Accept a single non-negative integer, coordinate indices, or coordinate names.

`group_by_*()`: As in **dplyr**, but don't allow grouping by coordinate variables.

`summarise_*()` or `amass_*()`: Replace $U$ or $V$ with centroids from a partition.

`transpose()`/`dualize()`: Interchange $U$ and $V$.

`rotate_*()`: Transform one factorization into another by a nonsingular rank-$r$ matrix.

Functions to calculate individual observations' or variables' contributions to error (SSE, stress, etc.), outlier/inlier status, or other atypicalities.

### bibble and tibble to bibble

`regress_onto()`: ?

`bind_u()` & `bind_v()`: Add new rows of $U$ and/or $V$ without changing the matrix transformations. _This functionality is of questionable utility and low-priority._

### two bibbles to one bibble

`bind()`: Augment the coordinates, and therefore both the $U$s and the $V$s, of two bibbles, leaving values of each zero at the other's coordinates (i.e. block matrices). _This functionality is of questionable utility and low-priority._

`align_with()`: Reorder the coordinates and/or flip their signs, when consistent with the meaning imbued in the factorization, to minimize the angle between the coordinates of an index bibble and those of an alter bibble or suitable matrix object.

### bibble to tibble

`get_*()`/`factor_*()`: Extract the annotated tibble form or the unannotated matrix form of $U$ or $V$.

`reconstruct()`: Multiply $U$ and $V'$ to recover or estimate the original data table or _target matrix_. More generally, include in each bibble a set of instructions (a formula?) for how to recover the raw data from the bibble and its annotations.

### extend methods from flattened bibbles to wrapped bibbles

## plotting

Incorporate `inertia` argument to `fortify()` and/or to `stat_biplot()`. Carefully document and justify the choice of where along the "typical" workflow to calculate the inertia.

Develop a generalized scree plot (`ggord() + geom_scree()`?) with options (variance explained, stress, etc.) appropriate to classes.

### plot layers

`*_isoline()`: Ensure that isolines respect non-linear transformations (e.g. `glm`).

### groupable plot layers

`*_centroid()`: Plot centroids as points, using the `group` aesthetic.

`*_ellipse()`: As in **ggbiplot**, using the `group` aesthetic. Include confidence ellipses, standard error ellipses, and ellipsoid hulls.

### non-aesthetic plot layers

`*_unit_circle()`: Plot a unit circle.

Implement an option to calibrate, in the Greenacre sense.

### text layers

Option to align text with vectors, as in **ggbiplot**.

## documentation

### summary information

Include keywords in the description: "biplot", "(linear) ordination" ([helpfully defined by JÃ¡nos Podani](http://ramet.elte.hu/~podani/7-Ordination.pdf)), "geometric data analysis".
Consider these when deciding on a final name.

### theory

Conceptualize each technique (and each of its variants) as a flow chart beginning with the raw data and progressing through each transformation, including the matrix factorization (with its objective function), ending with the two matrices from which the biplot is constructed.

Identify the calculations (e.g. projections) and visual elements (e.g. ellipses) that are appropriate to the biplots obtained using each technique.

## testing

Include thorough **testthat** examples of all methods.

## performance

### C++ implementations
